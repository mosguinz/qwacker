## Commands

### Channel archival

```
/archive to_archive destination [suffix]
```

* `to_archive` -- Text channel or category to archive.
* `destination` -- Category to move the text channels to.
    * This category's permission should be read-only. The bot does not enforce this. It will inherit the permissions of
      the parent.
* `suffix` (optional) -- Suffix to add to channel names.

### Discussion Leader setup

Creates @Team DL and ‚ùìask-channels for Discussion Leaders.

```
/dl setup category role_channel csv_file
```

* `category` -- Category to create the "‚ùìask-name" channels.
* `role_channel` -- The channel to post the role assignment embed.
    * This channel should be read-only. The bot does not enforce this.
* `csv_file` -- A CSV file in the format described below.

  assignment. If empty, a random emoji will be chosen.
